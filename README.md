__What's this?__

NOTE: This is now only supported by NewRecruit, Battlescribe has been deprecated.

This repository was based off the work of the Fundamalleus and many other community members in 9e to catch Apocalypse up to 10th edition. Certain datasheets felt very behind if you current played (slow thousand sons, daemon engines hitting on 4s, force orgs not matching up at all, firstborn marines still having 1W, etc). It's a GitHub repository of datafiles. 

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yes! The files should be downloadable directly through github

Add a new data source to NewRecruit from github, using this URL (https://github.com/th3proj3ct/wh40k-apocalypse-10e) with "Latest Commit" selected
